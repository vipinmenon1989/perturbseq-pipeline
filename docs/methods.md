# Methods

What the pipeline computes, why, and where it deliberately differs from the
prototype notebooks in `notebooks/prototype/`.

---

## 1. Input handling

### 10x MTX mode

Each lane is read with `sc.read_10x_mtx(..., gex_only=False)` so guide features
come along with gene expression. Lanes are concatenated with
`sc.concat(label='lane_id', keys=..., index_unique='-')`.

`sc.concat` keeps only `var` columns that are identical across objects, which
silently drops `feature_types` when lanes disagree. The prototype notebook
worked around this by reassigning `adata_full.var = adata_full1.var` after the
fact. Here the feature sets are **checked for identity first** — a lane
quantified against a different reference or guide library raises an error rather
than producing a matrix whose `var` annotation belongs to a different lane.

Features are then split into gene expression and guides. Guides are re-indexed
by their unique feature ID (`gene_ids`, e.g. `AFF4_P1P2_1`), because the symbol
column repeats across the six guides targeting one gene.

### h5ad mode

Three layouts are detected, in order:

1. **guide features in `var`** — split exactly as in MTX mode;
2. **companion guide `.h5ad`** — joined on the barcode intersection, with a
   warning if the two files do not fully overlap;
3. **pre-computed per-cell label** in `obs` (e.g. a Seurat `genotype` column) —
   parsed directly; guide-count diagnostics are then unavailable, which the
   report states.

Seurat exports commonly keep raw counts in `X` and log-normalized values in
`layers['logcounts']`. Point `input.counts_layer` / `input.normalized_layer` at
them and the pipeline will not re-normalize already-normalized data.

### Sample metadata

Required for any run spanning more than one lane. Joined on `lane_id`; every
column is merged into `obs` and written into the output `.h5ad`. Missing rows
for a present lane are an error, not a silent `NaN`. The requirement is waived
when the input already carries sample annotation (re-analyzing an `.h5ad` this
pipeline wrote).

---

## 2. Quality control

QC metrics are computed **before** the strict filters run, so the diagnostic
figures show the distribution the thresholds acted on rather than the already
truncated one.

| Stage | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| pre-filter | `min_genes_per_cell: 200`, `min_cells_per_gene: 3` | drop empty droplets and never-detected genes |
| metrics | `pct_counts_mt`, `pct_counts_ribo`, `pct_counts_hb` | via `sc.pp.calculate_qc_metrics` |
| strict filter | `min_genes_final: 1000`, `max_pct_mt: 20` | matches the prototype notebook |

Gene classes are matched case-insensitively, and a warning is emitted when the
mitochondrial prefix matches nothing (the usual cause is a mouse dataset with
human `MT-` settings, which would otherwise yield `pct_counts_mt = 0` and a
filter that silently does nothing).

Every filtering step records cells and genes before/after; that table appears in
the report.

### Perturb-seq-specific QC

* guide UMI depth per cell,
* guides detected per cell above `detection_threshold` → MOI estimate,
* top-vs-second guide counts, with the dominance threshold drawn on the plot,
* assignment outcome (targeting / non-targeting / ambiguous / unassigned),
  overall and **per lane**,
* guide and target representation, showing under-represented or absent guides.

The report also carries automatic warnings: low assignment rate, no
non-targeting controls detected, high ambiguous fraction, high multiplet rate.

---

## 3. Guide calling

For each cell, the highest and second-highest guide counts are found, then:

```
top == 0                                        -> unassigned
top >= min_umi  and  top > ratio x second       -> assigned to that guide
otherwise                                       -> ambiguous
```

Defaults: `min_umi = 3`, `dominance_ratio = 2.0`.

**Differences from the prototypes.** The notebooks looped over every cell in
Python (`for i in range(adata_guide.X.shape[0])`, printing progress every 10,000
cells); this is a chunked vectorized top-2 search that densifies at most 20,000
rows at a time. On the demo lane it assigns 27,541 cells in about one second.
The notebooks also used two different dominance ratios (1.2 in one, 2.0 in the
other) and no minimum UMI threshold; both are now single documented config keys.

Ambiguous and unassigned cells are **kept** in the object and counted in the
report. They are excluded from perturbation testing but never deleted, so the
assignment rate stays auditable.

### Target-gene parsing

Guide identifiers are split on `_`, `-` and `.`, taking the first field:

| Guide ID | Target |
|---|---|
| `AFF4_P1P2_1` (10x features file) | `AFF4` |
| `AFF4-P1P2.2` (Seurat `genotype`) | `AFF4` |
| `non_targeting_7` | `non` → non-targeting |

Set `guides.target_regex` when target names themselves contain a delimiter
(`NKX2-5`, for example).

Non-targeting guides are recognized by pattern (`non`, `non_targeting`, `NTC`,
`scramble`, `safe_harbor`) and collapsed to one `non-targeting` label.

---

## 4. Clustering

Library-size normalization → `log1p` → HVG selection (3,000 by default) →
scaling → PCA (50 PCs) → optional Harmony on `cluster.batch_key` → neighbor
graph → UMAP → Leiden (`flavor="igraph"`).

### Clustering on assigned singlets (`cluster.assigned_only`)

Clustering otherwise runs on every QC-passing cell, including the `ambiguous`
droplet multiplets flagged by `guides.max_second_umi`. Those cells survive
gene-expression QC (a multiplet is not low-quality, just two cells) and fragment
the embedding into many small clusters — on M0_ch1, 123 clusters instead of 37.

With `cluster.assigned_only: true` the run embeds **twice**:

1. **All QC-passing cells** — normalization, HVG, PCA, optional Harmony, UMAP and
   Leiden over everything. This produces the `all_cells_*` figures (including
   `all_cells_umap_assignment_class`, where the ambiguous and unassigned cells
   are visible) and is written as its own object,
   `<h5ad_name>_all_cells.h5ad` (`output.write_unfiltered_h5ad`).
2. **Guide-assigned singlets only** — the object is filtered to
   `targeting`/`non-targeting` cells, the first embedding is discarded, and HVG
   selection, PCA, Harmony, UMAP and Leiden are recomputed from scratch. Every
   downstream stage (perturbation strength, cluster enrichment, PS scores,
   lochNESS) runs on this object, and it is the processed `.h5ad`.

Re-embedding rather than reusing the all-cell PCA matters: HVG selection and the
principal components are themselves fit on the cells given to them, so a shared
embedding would let multiplets shape the space that lochNESS and the cluster
tests operate in. Normalization is per-cell and so is not repeated.

Because the two objects are embedded independently, **their cluster labels are
not comparable** — cluster 5 in the all-cells file has nothing to do with
cluster 5 in the analysed file. The all-cells file is a QC and provenance
artefact; the analysed file is the one to quote results from.

The layer contract afterwards:

| Slot | Contents |
|---|---|
| `layers['counts']` | raw integer counts |
| `layers['lognorm']` | log1p of normalized counts |
| `X` | the same log-normalized values |

Scaling is applied for PCA only; `X` is restored to log-normalized values
afterwards. **Perturbation tests read `layers['lognorm']` explicitly**, never
`X`, so a scaling step cannot silently change what is being tested — a real risk
in the notebook workflow, where `sc.pp.scale` and the KS test both operated on
whatever `X` happened to hold.

---

## 5. Perturbation strength

For each target gene *g* that is also measured in the expression matrix, the
expression of *g* itself is compared between:

* **perturbed cells** — assigned to a guide against *g*, and
* **control cells** — under two definitions, reported side by side.

### Control definitions

| Key | Cells | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| `ntc` | assigned to non-targeting guides | same transduction and selection, no on-target effect — the cleaner comparison |
| `other` | assigned to a *different* target gene | much larger n, but every control cell is itself perturbed, which dilutes apparent effects |

The prototype notebooks used `ambiguous` cells, or "all cells not labelled *g* or
`unassigned`", as controls. Since the library carries 30 dedicated
non-targeting guides, `ntc` is the default primary control here; `other`
reproduces the notebook comparison. Ambiguous and unassigned cells are never
used as controls. The report states which control drove the ranking, and a
scatter plot compares effect sizes under both — targets that disagree between
the two are exactly the ones worth a second look.

### Statistics

For each target/control pair:

| Quantity | Definition |
|---|---|
| `log2fc` | `log2(mean(expm1(perturbed)) / mean(expm1(control)))` — fold change on de-logged means |
| `pct_knockdown` | the same restated as a percentage drop |
| `ks_stat`, `ks_pval` | two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (as in the notebooks) |
| `mwu_pval_less` | one-sided Mann–Whitney U testing *perturbed < control* |
| `ks_fdr`, `mwu_fdr` | Benjamini–Hochberg across all tested targets |

A target is called **effective** when `ks_fdr < 0.05` **and** `log2fc < 0`.

The direction requirement matters: a KS test is two-sided and will happily
report a significant difference for a target whose expression went *up*. The
notebooks reported the p-value alone, leaving direction to visual inspection of
the ECDF. Multiple-testing correction is likewise new — testing ~60 targets at
an uncorrected α = 0.05 expects around three false positives.

Targets that cannot be tested — not measured in the expression matrix, or fewer
than `min_cells_per_target` cells — are listed with the reason rather than
dropped.

---

## 6. Cluster enrichment

Section 5 asks whether a guide knocked its target down. This asks the follow-on
question: **did losing that gene push cells into a particular transcriptional
state?** For most screens this is the phenotype of interest.

### The test

For every (target, cluster) pair, a 2x2 table

```
              in cluster    elsewhere
    target        a             b
    reference     c             d
```

is tested with **Fisher's exact test** (two-sided), with BH-FDR across all pairs
within a control arm.

An exact test is used rather than chi-square residuals for a concrete reason: on
the demo lane **26% of the expected counts are below 5**, because the rare
clusters hold very few reference cells. Chi-square is therefore reported only as
an omnibus screen, alongside a **permutation p-value** that does not rely on the
approximation.

### Why `other` is the default reference here

The perturbation-strength test defaults to non-targeting controls. This one does
not, and the demo data shows why:

| Cluster | NTC cells | Other-target cells |
|---|---|---|
| 7 | 3 | 127 |
| 9 | 4 | 142 |

Clusters 7 and 9 are exactly where the strongest effects live. Against a 3-cell
denominator an odds ratio is nearly meaningless, and any moderate effect would
be invisible. Both arms are still computed and reported; `other` drives ranking
and hit calling.

### Guarding the numbers

* **Haldane-Anscombe correction** (+0.5 to each cell) keeps odds ratios finite
  when a count is zero.
* Pairs whose reference contributes fewer than `min_reference_cells` cells in a
  cluster are **flagged low-power** rather than silently trusted.
* Clusters smaller than `min_cells_per_cluster` are not tested at all.

### Guide-level concordance

Each target carries several guides, so a real phenotype should appear across
more than one of them; a single-guide artefact will not. For every significant
pair the pipeline reports how many of the target's guides independently show the
same effect.

Agreement is judged **against the observed direction** — a guide supports an
enrichment when its cells sit in the cluster more often than the reference, and
supports a depletion when they sit there less often. Testing only the enrichment
direction would report every genuine depletion as "0 guides agreeing", which
reads as the exact opposite of the truth.

### Multi-lane runs

Setting `enrichment.stratify_by` (e.g. to `lane_id`) replaces the pooled Fisher
test with **Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel** across strata, so a cluster that merely
differs in size between lanes cannot masquerade as a perturbation effect. Off by
default; the demo is a single lane.

### What it found on the demo lane

Omnibus chi-square = 9,218 on 590 df, permutation p < 0.001 — perturbation
identity and cluster are strongly associated. Twelve pairs reach FDR < 0.05,
and the pattern is biologically coherent:

* **SMARCC1** (core BAF/SWI-SNF subunit) takes over cluster 7 — 45% of its cells
  versus 0.2% of the reference — and is correspondingly depleted from three
  other clusters. All five testable guides agree.
* **EZH2 and SUZ12**, both core PRC2 subunits, are independently enriched in the
  same cluster 9, together with SALL4, NANOG and CTNNB1.

Two members of one complex landing on the same phenotype, from independent
guides, is the analysis validating itself — no prior knowledge of the complexes
enters the computation.

## 7. Per-cell perturbation response (PS_python)

Sections 5 and 6 treat every cell carrying a guide as one group. A perturbed
population is rarely uniform, though: some cells are genuinely knocked down
while others escape entirely. This stage adds the per-cell view by delegating to
[**PS_python**](https://github.com/weili-lab/PS_python), the lab's implementation
of the scMAGeCK perturbation score.

`pertps` is an **optional dependency** — the algorithm stays maintained in its
own repository rather than being copied here:

```bash
pip install -e ".[ps]"
```

When it is absent the stage is skipped and the report says so explicitly; set
`ps_score.require: true` to make a missing install a hard failure instead.

### What it computes

For each target, `pertps` finds the genes that respond most to the perturbation
(target cells versus non-targeting controls), fits the perturbation's expression
signature by ordinary least squares, and projects every cell onto it. The result
is a score per cell, shifted so the control mean is zero and scaled to [0, 1].

The pipeline adapts its own vocabulary to what `pertps` expects
(`obs['target_gene']` → `obs['gene']`, the NTC label → `Non-Targeting`) and hands
it the **log-normalized layer explicitly** — the score is a projection of
expression, so feeding scaled values would silently change it.

### Quadrants

Combining the score with the target's own expression classifies each perturbed
cell:

| Quadrant | Score | Target expression | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| successful knockdown | high | below control median | the perturbation worked |
| escaper | high | above control median | carries the guide, still expresses the gene |
| non-responder | low | above | indistinguishable from unperturbed |
| low signal | low | below | uninformative, often low quality |

The vertical cut is `ps_score.ps_threshold` (0.5, matching the PS_python demo);
the horizontal cut is the control population's median expression.

### The unexpressed-gene guard

A gene the controls do not express has a control median of zero, so **every**
cell falls on the "low expression" side and any high score is misread as a
successful knockdown. Without a guard the olfactory-receptor controls topped the
knockdown-efficiency ranking on the demo lane — OR2D3 at 51%, OR6A2 at 39% — a
pure artefact of the cut.

Targets below `perturbation.min_pct_expressing_control` in control cells are
therefore reported as untestable here too, the same rule the perturbation-
strength stage uses. On the demo lane that removes every OR gene plus LEF1 and
KLF4, leaving 46 of 54 targets scored.

### The supervised LDA embedding

`pertps.compute_lda_umap` builds a second embedding, and the distinction from
the one in section 4 matters. That UMAP is **unsupervised**: it is built from
expression alone and knows nothing about which guide a cell carries, so a
perturbation whose phenotype is subtle relative to the dominant axes of
variation can be invisible in it.

This one trains **linear discriminant analysis on the perturbation labels**,
then embeds the discriminant space with UMAP. The axes are therefore chosen to
separate perturbations, which is where the per-cell scores read most clearly.
It is the figure PS_python ships as `plots_fixed_lda/`.

Three figures come out of it: an overview coloured by perturbation, a global
summary highlighting cells above `ps_score.lda_highlight_threshold`, and one
per scored target showing its cells shaded by score against everything else in
grey.

Two caveats. The LDA is trained only on targets with enough cells plus the
control group, so **ambiguous and unassigned cells receive no coordinates** —
on the demo lane 21,281 of 27,541 cells are placed. And the step is expensive:
it scales the full matrix (which densifies it), runs PCA, LDA and a second
UMAP, costing a few minutes and a few GB. Set
`ps_score.compute_lda_umap: false` to skip it.

### Agreement with the group-level test

The two measurements are deliberately compared, but they are **not** measuring
the same quantity: the group-level test looks at the target's own expression,
while the score projects cells onto the perturbation's whole downstream
signature. A gene can be strongly knocked down yet change little downstream, or
the reverse.

Observed correlations are correspondingly modest — Pearson r = **-0.285** on the
demo lane (the expected direction: stronger knockdown, more confirmed cells) and
**+0.12** on the PS_python demo subset. The figure reports what the data show
rather than asserting the methods validate each other.

## 8. lochNESS neighbourhood enrichment

Ported from [pertTF](https://github.com/davidliwei/pertTF)
(`perttf.model.composition_change_analysis`). For every cell and every
perturbation *g*:

```
lochNESS(cell, g) = local_fraction(g) / overall_fraction(g) - 1
```

`local_fraction` is the share of that cell's *k* nearest neighbours carrying
*g*; `overall_fraction` is *g*'s share of the dataset. **0** means the
perturbation turns up among the neighbours exactly as often as chance predicts,
**> 0** locally over-represented, **< 0** under-represented.

### How it differs from section 6

Cluster enrichment tests discrete Leiden clusters and returns a significance
call. lochNESS is continuous and cluster-free, so it also sees structure that
lies inside a single cluster or straddles two — and it maps *where* a
perturbation accumulates rather than only *whether* it does. The two agreeing is
a good sign; structure visible only in lochNESS is worth following up.

### Neighbourhood size

`k = 300` by default, following pertTF. The clustering graph (`k = 15`) is far
too small here: with ~60 targets, a 15-cell neighbourhood is expected to hold a
quarter of a cell of any one perturbation, so the local fraction would be pure
sampling noise. A dedicated graph is therefore built, on `X_pca_harmony` when
batch correction ran so neighbourhoods are not defined by lane.

### Two departures from the reference

**Vectorized.** The original loops over every cell in Python with a `.loc`
lookup per neighbourhood. Each perturbation here is one sparse matrix-vector
product — what makes 60 targets over 100k cells practical.

**Denominator.** The original divides by the requested `n_neighbors`, while a
scanpy graph stores `n_neighbors - 1` entries per row (self excluded). Dividing
by the actual neighbour count removes a systematic under-estimate; at k = 300
the difference is ~0.3%.

`tests/test_pipeline.py` cross-checks the vectorized score against a literal
port of the reference loop: identical to 1e-16 with correlation 1.000000 once
the denominator difference is undone.

### What it found on the demo lane

| Target | mean lochNESS in own cells | peak cluster |
|---|---|---|
| SALL4 | 10.64 | 9 |
| SMARCC1 | 10.12 | 7 |
| EZH2 | 3.67 | 9 |
| CTNNB1 | 3.07 | 9 |
| NANOG | 2.96 | 9 |
| SUZ12 | 2.66 | 9 |

This independently reproduces the section-6 result — SMARCC1 in cluster 7, the
PRC2/pluripotency group in cluster 9 — by a completely different route, with no
clusters and no significance test involved.

## 9. Co-functional Modules & Gene Programs

Based on [Chen et al. 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06733-x), the pipeline constructs a regulome map:
* **Perturbation Effect Matrix**: A target $\times$ gene differential expression matrix of $\log_2\text{FC}$ values vs control (`tables/effect_matrix.csv`).
* **Co-functional Modules**: Hierarchical clustering on Spearman correlation between perturbation effect profiles groups transcription factors and targets that regulate similar downstream programs (`tables/cofunctional_modules.csv`).
* **Co-regulated Programs**: Hierarchical clustering on Pearson correlation between downstream genes groups co-regulated transcript sets (`tables/gene_programs.csv`).
* **Biological Pathway Enrichment & Functional Annotation**: Over-Representation Analysis (ORA / hypergeometric test) mapping data-driven gene programs to biological processes (MSigDB Hallmark, Reactome, GO Biological Process, and KEGG):
  $$P(X \ge k) = \sum_{i=k}^{\min(n, M)} \frac{\binom{M}{i} \binom{N - M}{n - i}}{\binom{N}{n}}$$
  where background universe $N$ is rigorously scoped to the Stage 7 eligible perturbation-effect genes, $M$ is the pathway size in universe, $n$ is the program size, and $k$ is the overlap. Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction is applied per program. Significant pathways (FDR $\le 0.05$) annotate programs (`tables/program_enrichment.csv`, `tables/program_summary.csv`).
* **Module $\times$ Program Strength**: Matrix multiplication quantifying the signed regulatory activation/repression between each module and biologically annotated program (`tables/module_program_strength.csv`).
* **TF-Hub Networks**: Network graphs visualizing regulatory hub connectivity (`tables/tf_hubs.csv`, `tables/tf_edges.csv`).

---

## 10. Perturbation Distance & Permutation DistanceTest

### Biological Motivation: Efficacy vs Phenotype Magnitude
While direct target $\log_2\text{FC}$ answers whether the guide depleted its intended transcript, **Perturbation Distance** quantifies the global shift of the high-dimensional multivariate cell distribution:
* **Strong Knockdown + Small Distance**: On-target efficacy with minimal global phenotypic perturbation.
* **Modest Knockdown + Large Distance**: Downstream regulatory cascades or state transitions.

### Primary Metric: Energy Distance
Evaluated non-parametrically in single-cell latent space (e.g. PCA `adata.obsm['X_pca']`):
$$D^2(P, Q) = 2\,\mathbb{E}_{X \sim P, Y \sim Q}[\|X - Y\|_2] - \mathbb{E}_{X, X' \sim P}[\|X - X'\|_2] - \mathbb{E}_{Y, Y' \sim Q}[\|Y - Y'\|_2]$$
Energy distance equals zero if and only if distributions $P$ and $Q$ are identical ($P = Q$), capturing differences in mean centroid, covariance spread, manifold curvature, and multimodality.

### Finite-Permutation DistanceTest & Exact O(n^2) Identity
To determine whether an observed distance represents a statistically significant phenotypic shift vs control cells:
1. **Precomputed Distance Matrix & Row-Sum Identity**:
   For pooled target ($n$) and control ($m$) cells ($N = n + m$), the $N \times N$ pairwise Euclidean distance matrix $D$ is computed once.
   Let $R_i = \sum_{j=1}^N D[i, j]$ denote the precomputed row sums and $S_{total} = \sum_{i,j} D[i, j]$ the total sum of matrix $D$.
   For any partition into perturbed subset $X$ of size $n$ and control subset $Y$ of size $m = N - n$, the control submatrix sum $S_Y$ is computed exactly in $O(n^2)$ via:
   $$R_X = \sum_{i \in X} R_i, \quad S_X = \sum_{i \in X, j \in X} D[i, j]$$
   $$S_Y = S_{total} + S_X - 2 R_X$$
   $$E^2(X, Y) = \frac{2(R_X - S_X)}{n \cdot m} - \frac{S_X}{n^2} - \frac{S_Y}{m^2}$$
   This completely eliminates allocating and summing massive $m \times m$ submatrices across thousands of permutations, speeding up permutation significance tests by **45x–200x** while guaranteeing 100% mathematical and statistical exactness.

2. **Empirical P-value**:
   $$p = \frac{1 + \sum_{b=1}^B \mathbf{1}(D_{\text{perm}, b} \ge D_{\text{observed}})}{1 + B}$$

3. **Multiple Testing Correction**: Benjamini–Hochberg FDR is calculated across all tested targets.

4. **Bounded Sampling**: Cells are deterministically sampled up to `max_cells_per_target` (default: 2,000) and `max_control_cells` (default: 5,000) using a fixed random seed (`random_seed: 123`) to ensure scalable computation on million-cell datasets.

5. **Shared Multiprocessing Memory**: High-dimensional embeddings (e.g. `X_pca`) are shared across CPU worker processes via zero-copy memory buffers, preventing redundant AnnData serialization.

---

## 11. Perturbation Distance Space & Phenotype Modules

### All-vs-All Phenotype Similarity
DistanceSpace evaluates the symmetric target $\times$ target Energy Distance matrix between all pairs of perturbations:
* **Output Deliverables**:
  * `tables/perturbation_distance_matrix.tsv`: Complete pairwise distance matrix, stored outside H5AD.
  * `tables/perturbation_space_coordinates.csv`: Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA / classical MDS) low-dimensional coordinates.
  * `tables/perturbation_neighbors.csv`: Top-$k$ ranked nearest phenotypic neighbors per perturbation.
  * `tables/phenotype_modules.csv`: Hierarchical clustering partition into discrete **Phenotype Modules**.

### Phenotype Modules vs Co-functional Modules
* **Co-functional Modules** (Stage 7): Group perturbations by shared downstream differential expression profiles ($\log_2\text{FC}$ vectors). *Which perturbations regulate the same target genes?*
* **Phenotype Modules** (Stage 11): Group perturbations by geometric distribution similarity across single-cell states. *Which perturbations produce similar distributions on the cellular manifold?*

### Scaling Invariant: $O(P^2)$
Pairwise distance evaluation scales as $\frac{P(P - 1)}{2}$ pairs (e.g. ~1.62M pairs for 1,800 targets). DistanceSpace is recommended for focused inquiry or screens with moderate target counts, while routine exploratory pipelines focus on Distance-vs-control.

---

## 12. Master Perturbation Metadata & Visualizations

Target-level summaries across all stages are merged into `tables/perturbation_meta.csv`:
* Target efficacy (`target_log2fc`, `target_pct_kd`, `target_fdr`, `is_effective_hit`)
* PS cellular penetrance (`ps_mean`, `ps_median`, `ps_responder_fraction`, `ps_escaper_fraction`)
* lochNESS manifold topology (`lochness_mean`, `lochness_peak`, `lochness_pct_enriched`)
* Phenotype distance (`energy_distance`, `mmd_distance`, `distance_pvalue`, `distance_fdr`, `distance_significant`)
* Module classifications (`cofunctional_module`, `phenotype_module`)

> **Architectural Principle**: The pipeline never computes an arbitrary composite scalar score. All dimensions remain transparent and distinct.

---

## 13. Lean H5AD Storage Policy

The processed `.h5ad` file stores cell-level features exclusively:
* `adata.obs`: Per-cell labels (`target_gene`, `cluster`, `ps_score`, `ps_quadrant`, `lochness_self`).
* `adata.obsm`: Latent embeddings (`X_pca`, `X_umap`, `X_lda_umap`, `guide_counts`).
* Target-level tables, pairwise matrices, and networks are exported to `tables/` to eliminate memory bloat in single-cell loaders.

---

## 14. Figures and the report

Every figure passes through a registry that records its path, title, caption and
section, so a figure cannot be produced without being reachable from the report.

Per-target figures (ECDF + violin + UMAP highlight) are generated for **every**
tested target. The `perturbation.top_n_report` strongest are embedded inline;
the rest are written to `figures/perturbation/per_gene/` and linked from the
report by name. Nothing is silently truncated.

The report embeds figures as base64 data URIs, making it a single portable HTML
file that can be shared without an accompanying folder.

---

## 15. Compute Architecture & Hardware Placement

The pipeline features a unified, hardware-aware execution layer (`perturbseq_pipeline.compute`)
designed to execute statistical and linear algebra workloads efficiently across modern CPU clusters and GPU workstations.

### Design Philosophy

1. **CPU Multiprocessing for Statistical Workloads**:
   Target-level evaluations (direct perturbation strength, cluster enrichment Fisher/CMH tests,
   permutation DistanceTests, and phenotype neighborhood calculations) are embarrassingly parallel.
   Multiprocessing parallelizes across perturbation targets or target pairs using `joblib` worker pools.
   Rather than serializing entire multi-hundred-thousand or million-cell AnnData objects, workers receive
   only minimal sliced index vectors or pre-aggregated summary arrays.

2. **Selective GPU Acceleration**:
   GPU acceleration is treated as an optional accelerator for dense linear algebra operations (such as
   large matrix correlations, RAPIDS single-cell neighbor graph construction, and high-dimensional embeddings)
   rather than a default environment for all code. CPU execution remains the primary, fully supported default.
   GPU libraries (`cupy`, `cuml`, `rapids_singlecell`) are optional extras (`pip install -e ".[gpu]"`).

3. **Orthogonality of STANDARD / LARGE and CPU / GPU**:
   The biological scaling modes (`STANDARD` vs `LARGE`) and hardware placement (`CPU` vs `GPU`) are
   strictly decoupled:
   - `STANDARD` datasets can execute on CPU or GPU.
   - `LARGE` datasets can execute on CPU (via chunked/sufficient-statistic algorithms) or GPU.

4. **SLURM Cluster Awareness & Thread Oversubscription Prevention**:
   - On SLURM HPC nodes, worker allocation automatically queries `SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`, `SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE`,
     and CPU process affinity rather than blindly utilizing all physical cores on a shared node.
   - Internal numerical library threading (OpenBLAS, MKL, OpenMP) within worker subprocesses is constrained
     via `threadpoolctl` (`blas_threads_per_worker: 1`) to eliminate severe thread oversubscription penalties.

5. **GPU Memory Safety & Graceful Fallback**:
   Before dispatching operations to the GPU, matrix memory requirements are estimated and checked against
   available GPU VRAM (`gpu_memory_fraction: 0.80`). If GPU memory is insufficient or CUDA packages are absent,
   the pipeline emits an informative warning and falls back to deterministic CPU routines without crashing.

6. **Benchmarking & Profiling**:
   Every pipeline execution records stage execution runtimes, peak host RSS memory, and peak GPU VRAM allocations,
   exporting a comprehensive benchmark table to `tables/compute_profile.csv`.

## 16. Storage & Central Data Access Layer

To scale seamlessly from standard screens (~300k cells) to multi-million cell datasets (>2.5M cells), storage and data access are decoupled from biological analysis logic via `perturbseq_pipeline.data_access`:

### Architectural Separation
```
Storage / Data Access (in_memory / backed / auto)
        │
        ▼
Biological Analysis Modules (STANDARD / LARGE)
        │
        ▼
Compute Backend (CPU / GPU / AUTO)
```

1. **Selective Materialization**:
   Analysis modules never materialize full dense $N \times G$ gene expression matrices. Modules request only the specific representation they require:
   - Stage 4/10/11: Low-dimensional embeddings (`get_embedding(expr, rep_name='X_pca')`).
   - Stage 5: 1D target gene expression vectors (`get_expression_vector(expr, gene=...)`).
   - Stage 6/7/8: Target index mappings (`get_target_indices_map(expr)`), constructed once rather than repeatedly re-scanning boolean masks.

2. **Backed H5AD Support**:
   For ultra-large datasets exceeding `storage.backed_threshold_cells` (default: 1,000,000 cells), the expression matrix can be opened in read-only backed mode (`sc.read_h5ad(path, backed='r')`). Metadata (`obs`, `var`) and low-dimensional embeddings (`obsm`) remain in memory, allowing downstream topology, enrichment, and distance calculations to run with minimal host RAM footprint.

3. **Multiprocessing Zero-Copy Memory Sharing**:
   When parallelizing across CPU workers (`compute.*_n_jobs`), shared arrays (such as PCA embeddings) are managed via `SharedArrayBuffer` (memory mapping / shared read-only buffers). Workers receive lightweight slice tasks instead of serialized AnnData closures, eliminating memory bloat and worker startup latency.
